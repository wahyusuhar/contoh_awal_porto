Bootstrap Photo Portfolio is a Github repository that provides a responsive and customizable template for creating a photo portfolio website. The template is built using Bootstrap, a popular CSS framework that allows for easy and consistent styling across different devices and screen sizes.
The repository includes a set of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files that provide the foundation for the photo portfolio website. The HTML files include a basic layout structure for displaying the portfolio images and descriptions, while the CSS files provide the styling and layout of the website. The JavaScript files are used to add interactive features such as a responsive navigation menu and image sliders.
Users can customize the template by adding their own images, changing the text and layout, and modifying the CSS styles to fit their preferences. The repository also includes documentation on how to use and customize the template.
